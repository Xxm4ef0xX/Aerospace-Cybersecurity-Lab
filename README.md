# Aerospace Cybersecurity Lab

## Overview
This repository documents a research project focused on **embedded systems security and aerospace communications**. The primary goal is to design, construct, and audit a **FlatSat** (a satellite bus deployed on a test bench) to analyze vulnerabilities in low-power telemetry links and develop robust security countermeasures.


## System Architecture
The system simulates a distributed satellite environment:
- **Space Segment (Payload):** Arduino Nano, DHT22 sensor (telemetry), and HC-12 transceiver.
- **Ground Segment:** Raspberry Pi 4 acting as the On-Board Computer (OBC) and primary transceiver.
- **Auditing Tools:** RTL-SDR v4 and HackRF One for RF spectrum analysis and traffic sniffing.

## Security Implementation
To ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the telemetry data, this project implements AES-128 (ECB Mode) symmetric encryption:
End-to-End Encryption: Data is encrypted on the source before transmission and decrypted at the destination.
Obfuscation: Base64 encoding is utilized to protect the encrypted binary payload during transit.
Credential Management: Sensitive API keys are isolated in a local config.py file, excluded from version control to prevent leaks.

## Learning Roadmap

- [X] Phase 1: Hardware Integration. Assembly, soldering, and configuration of the FlatSat nodes.
- [X] Phase 2: Telemetry Link. Implementation of UART serial protocols for robust data transmission.
- [X] Phase 3: RF Auditing. Signal analysis in the 433MHz band using SDR to detect information leakage. (Optimization: Channel 20 established).
- [X] Phase 4: Resilience & Defense. Implementation of persistent data logging (SQLite) and investigation of common attacks.
- [ ] Phase 5: Encryption & Advanced Security. Implementation of AES-128 and traffic obfuscation techniques.
